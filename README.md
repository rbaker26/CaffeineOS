# CaffeineOS
My first OS fueled by caffeine.  

This is a learning project, we will see how far it goes. 
When I say "fueled by caffeine", I literally mean caffeine, not some new OS building framework. But that would be a pretty cool name for an OS building framework.

## Getting Started
I am running this project in Ubuntu18.04 LTS.
The following are the packages I installed in the order I installed them to get this project going:
 * g++
 * clang
 * make
 * gcc-multilib
 * g++-multilib
 * virtualbox-qt
 * valgrind
 * xorriso

## Progress Log  

3/2/2020 1658 PST  
Right now I have a bootable kernal.  It does nothing but print out the OS Name.
So far I have followed totorials, but very few cover anything past this point.  None I found use C++, only C.

I am researching what is the next part of the kernel I should build next. 
My guess is dynamic memory. 
Currently I am achiving output using a VGA address to write text to the screen.  I haven't figured out input yet.
As I said, tutorials dont really get past the bootable "Hello World" OS.
